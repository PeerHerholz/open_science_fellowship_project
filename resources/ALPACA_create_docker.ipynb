    "[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers. Those containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, system tools, software libraries, such as [Python](https://www.python.org), neuroimaging related software such as [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSL), [AFNI](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov), [SPM](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/), [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu), [ANTs](http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/) and pretty much any other open source software or tools. This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in. As this notebook will just briefly talk about docker and it's application, make sure you go through this very nice and comprehensive [introduction to docker](http://nipy.org/workshops/2017-03-boston/lectures/lesson-container/#1).\n",

Additionally, and I can't stress this enough, it's incredibly useful. Now, let's check some basic docker commands:"

The exact implementation of that is a bit different for Windows user, but the general commands look similar. The standard version goes something like this:\n",

    "- the `-v` flag tells docker which folders should be mount to make them accesible inside the container. Here:   /path/to/resources is your local directory where you stored notebooks, functions, scripts. /path/to/data/ is a directory where you stored your data, and /path/to/output can be an empty directory that will be used for output. - The second part of the `-v` flag (here: /home/resources, /data or /output) specifies under which path the mounted folders can be found inside the container. Important: To use the resource, data, output or any other folder, you first need to create them on your local system!\n",

    "You might think: do I really need to know this and why is it important anyway? Well, besides a bunch of points, here are two very obvious and major points: reproducibility and sharing/standardization. Focusing the first, the [introduction section](#docker---reproducibility-in-a-container) already briefly mentioned that through the possibility of wrapping up entire systems/setups, docker is a great tool with regard to reproducibility. More precisely, you can provide the exact same setup you used for a certain analysis or even study together with the respective so that others (fellow researchers, reviewers, your friends and family, etc.) can reproduce your results or apply your work to new data with ease. Along many positive effects this also boosts your integrity, big time. Focusing the latter, docker also helps you collaborating with peeps and to establish standards, increasing your impact tremendously. If you've developed a great and robust pipeline, why not share it with others so that they can benefit from it as well? Maybe you'll also be able to support the further standardization of neuroinformatics related applications (in terms of state of the art and best practise, of course), like e.g. [BIDS apps](http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io) do. After all we're all in this together and for (neuro-)science, not for our egos."
