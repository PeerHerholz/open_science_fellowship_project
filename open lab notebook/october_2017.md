# October, 9th - 15th, 2017
## this week

- checked ethic committee requirements 
- reread journal and overview articles
- google hangout with [Kevin Sitek](https://github.com/sitek) and [Omer Faruk Gulban](https://github.com/ofgulban),
  both collaborators, to discuss study stimuli, design, possible analyses --> Faruk might be able to provide the stimuli
  and experiment script which he used in [his previous studies wrt the auditory cortex and pathway](https://figshare.com/authors/Omer_Faruk_Gulban/3931136)
  
  
## next week
  
 - generate tone burst stimuli
 - start writing ethic proposal
 - check equipment at the scanner related to auditory research

# Ocotber, 16th - 22th, 2017
## this week
- talk with different at the department about posting and documenting the ethic proposal process <br /> 
  &rarr; doesn't seem to work out at all, as all information wrt the proposal are considered "highly confidential" <br /> 
  &rarr; currently checking options, e.g. how much it has to "change" till I'd be allowed to post and if I could post it<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; after the project is completed
- auditory research equipment at the scanner looks good and seems to work properly, I'll post some pictures of the setup soon
- spend some time rereading original study and overview articles especially wrt stimuli and experimental design <br />
  &rarr; [here's](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/open_science_fellowship_project/blob/master/open%20lab%20notebook/articles_list_auditory_cortex.md) the list of articles you maybe also find useful and [here's](https://openknowledgemaps.org/map/530b543e87c83d2de62f331f04625d0a) the open knowledge map again <br />
  &rarr; I'll soon post a jupyter notebook containing information about and showing the process of <br /> 
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; generating tone bursts here <br />
  &rarr; checking best possible experimental design based on previous studies using <br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;[NeuroPowerTools, more precisely Neurodesign](http://neuropowertools.org/design/start/), make sure to 
                      also check their github repo [here](https://github.com/neuropower/neurodesign) and the <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  [preprint describing this amazing toolbox](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/23/119594)<br /> &rarr; when it's done, I'll post the generated code and results here  <br />
  &rarr; introduced the structure I use to document the project here to students writing their thesis under <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my supvervision and other folks in our gang, check their repos e.g. [here](https://github.com/MirjamSchneider/MSc_thesis_MirjamSchneider) or [here](https://github.com/Brinkmak/BSc_thesis_KlaraBrinkmann)  <br />
  &rarr; further planning of the "open /reproducible neuroscience using python" workshop, which will take place <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; next March, 9th-11th

## next week
- further checking of ethic proposal related problems
- check availability of certain scanner sequences to continue paradigm planning
- make list of plannend analysis and possible problems
