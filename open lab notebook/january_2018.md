# January 8th - 14th, 2018
## this week
- more meetings with different departments wrt our [open science initiative](https://openscienceinitiativeuniversitymarburg.github.io)
- it's planned that [José](https://github.com/JoseAlanis) will give a talk at the psychology department
at the 29th
- finished interim report and uploaded it to [github](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/open_science_fellowship_project/blob/master/open%20lab%20notebook/ALPACA_Zwischenbericht.md)
and the [project's wikiversity site](https://de.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Fellow-Programm_Freies_Wissen/Einreichungen/ALPACA_–_Automated_Labelling_and_Parcellation_of_Auditory_Cortex_Areas/Zwischenbericht)
- uploaded first half of pre-analyses tutorial, which deals with data structure and prerequisites, check it [here](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/open_science_fellowship_project/blob/master/resources/ALPACA_data_organization_prerequisites.ipynb) 
- finished the first draft of the ALPACA docker image and pushed it to [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/peerherholz/alpaca/)
  - as you can see, it's way too heavy, as I included complete software packages and modules from which I intend to only use certain subfunctions &rarr; hence, I'll work on minimizing the docker image
  - you can check the shell script I used to create and build the docker image in my [resources folder](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/open_science_fellowship_project/blob/master/resources/ALPACA_create_dockerfile.sh) &rarr; it uses the amazing [neurodocker](https://hub.docker.com/r/kaczmarj/neurodocker/) and besides rebuilding of ALPACA also allows easy adaption for other docker images
  - I'll upload a jupyter notebook on how to create and build the docker image within the next few days

## next week
- finish the tutorial notebooks
- pipeline for converting and preprocessing files on the new server system
