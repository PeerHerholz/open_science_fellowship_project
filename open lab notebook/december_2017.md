# December 4th - December 10th, 2017
## this week
- more work on the anatomical workflow
  - including more ROIs/ same probabilistic ROIs regarding the auditory system from different atlases <br/>
    &rarr; from [freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) [parcellation](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/CorticalParcellation) <br/>
    &rarr; [Harvard-Oxford-Atlas](http://neuro.debian.net/pkgs/fsl-harvard-oxford-atlases.html) as included in [fsl](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Atlases)<br/>
    &rarr; [BASC](https://figshare.com/articles/basc/1285615) as included in [nilearn](http://nilearn.github.io) <br/>
    &rarr; [Allen 2011](http://mialab.mrn.org/data/index.html) as included in [nilearn](http://nilearn.github.io) <br/>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- they have a lot of very cool and rare data [freely available online](http://www.brainspan.org/static/atlas?_ga=2.10356337.518479951.1512721284-688602235.1512721284)
- appointments with the [linguistics](https://www.uni-marburg.de/fb09/igs) and [mathematics & computer science department](https://www.uni-marburg.de/fb12/en/index_html?set_language=en) regarding possible collaborations and open science
  
## next week
- finish anatomical processing pipeline
- create graph for the whole processing pipeline


# December 11th - 17th, 2017
## this week
- didn't manage to finish the anatomical worklfow, but still made some progress
  - currently working on combining all subworkflows into one
- finally put the website for the ["open & reproducible neuroscience using python" workshop](https://openreproneuro2018marburg.github.io) online
  - this whole thing is part of my fellowship project, as, besides the work on the auditory cortex, I also
    wanted to foster open science in our department/institute and the whole university
  - the workshop is a satellite event of the [60th teap](https://www.teap.de/index.php/teap2018/marburg)
  - it will pass into the first Marburg Brainhack which will take during the conference
- further planning of collaborations on open science

## next week
- once again: finish the anatomical processing pipeline
- upload a jupyter notebook describing how to get different freely available atlases
  and how extract and save certain ROIs
