# March 19th - 25th, 2018

## this week
- 2nd instance of the workshop (@[Fiebach lab](http://www.fiebachlab.org) was very interesting, exciting and fun
  - way smaller group than in the marburg instance
  - more in depth and detailed discussions
- started planning the first brainhack Marburg which will be part of the [Brainhack Global 2018](http://www.brainhack.org/global2017/) and take place 03.-05.05.2018
  - possible locations: [new university library](https://www.uni-marburg.de/aktuelles/bau/campusfirmanei/UB/index_html?language_sync=1) which will open in two weeks or the ["old university"](https://www.uni-marburg.de/de/universitaet/service/angebote/tagen/raumbuchung/alte-aula)
- server system communication with the outside world
  - right now the docker images have to transferred via USB as the network has a download limit of 200 mb
  - most smaller updates of docker images are then possible via the command line
  - working on different possible solutions 

## next week
- further planning of the brainhack
- setting up a pipeline supporting the first person to use the server system besides me
