# open science fellowship project
This is the repo for the project I'm working on during my time as an [open science fellow](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Deutschland/Open_Science_Fellows_Program). 

The project itself is called ALPACA - Automated Labelling and Parcellation of Auditory Cortex Areas, for a brief description you can check my original submission for the fellow program [here](https://de.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Fellow-Programm_Freies_Wissen/Einreichungen/ALPACA_â€“_Automated_Labelling_and_Parcellation_of_Auditory_Cortex_Areas) (currently only in German, but I'll upload an english version soon). Interested in the topic? Check the open knowledge map for the search term "auditory cortex" and based on pubmed [here](https://openknowledgemaps.org/map/530b543e87c83d2de62f331f04625d0a).

It'll contain information about all project parts, from [ethics committee submissions](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/open_science_fellowship_project/tree/master/ethics%20committee%20submission) to finished code. Furthermore you can
find an [open lab notebook](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/open_science_fellowship_project/tree/master/open%20lab%20notebook) documenting and tracking the progress as well as changes on a weekly basis.
